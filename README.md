# OOP-summative

1. What is the difference between OOP and Procedural coding?
Procedural coding and OOP differ in a few ways. First, OOP is a much more complex way of coding. OOP uses an object oriented approach to make it simpler in cases
where you are dealing with long codes with actual objects that you want to assign values to. Normal Procedural coding just goes on through the code and assigns 
values as it goes.

2. How would your program differ if it were made in procedural coding instead?
My program would likely have be much more complicated to write since it would be hard to keep track of what variable have what values and it wouldn't fit together
as well. It would also probably be longer due to having to use some of the same code multiple times throught the code.

3. What are the benefits of OOP?
The benefits of OOP are that it allows you to be a low more organized, save time, and even allow you to do more. By thinking of things as objects it is easier to 
go through your code and not have to worry about reassigning multiple values and multiple variables over and over again. Although it is hard to understand at first
it can save you time and brain cells in the end.

4. What are the drawbacks?
The draw backs of OOP are that it is not always needed and it can make things overcomplicated sometimes. With most smaller codes or code that isn't using something like
pygame, you are less likely to need OOP. This is because it is mainly used for say something like games where a character or object is being used often and it simplifies
using that character or object multiple times. in most things that I will code it probably won't be necessary.
